# SimpleNem12Parser

## Task
* Expected duration: 3-4 hours
* Requires Java 8
* Solution can be in Java (preferably Java8) or Groovy

NEM12 is a file format used to represent meter read data from smart meters.

You are given a sample of a simplified version of the NEM12 file.  You are also given the domain model to represent the data in this file.  Here are more details.

Refer to comments for following files.
* `EnergyUnit.java`
* `MeterRead.java`
* `MeterVolume.java`
* `Quality.java`
* `SimpleNem12Parser.java`
* `TestHarness.java`

### SimpleNem12.csv format specifications
* You can assume, for this exercise, that no quotes or extraneous commas appear in the CSV data.
* First item on every line is the RecordType
* RecordType 100 must be the first line in the file
* RecordType 900 must be the last line in the file
* RecordType 200 represents the start of a meter read block.  This record has the following subsequent items (after RecordType).
You can assume each file does not contain more than one RecordType 200 with the same NMI.
  * NMI ("National Metering Identifier") - String ID representing the meter on the site, modelled in `MeterRead.nmi`.  Value should always be 10 chars long.
  * EnergyUnit - Energy unit of the meter reads, modelled in `EnergyUnit` enum type and `MeterRead.energyUnit`.
* RecordType 300 represents the volume of the meter read for a particular date.  This record has the following subsequent items (after RecordType).
  * Date - In the format yyyyMMdd (e.g. 20170102 is 2nd Jan, 2017).  Modelled in `MeterRead.volumes` map key.
  * Volume - Signed number value.  Modelled in `MeterVolume.volume`.
  * Quality - Represents quality of the meter read, whether it's Actual (A) or Estimate (E).  Value should always be A or E.  Modelled in `MeterVolume.quality`

Your tasks:
1. Write a list of any questions you would have to clarify these requirements.
- what do we do with exceptions/ record errors found in csv file ? should we stop processing the file if there are record errors ?
- given that one csv file per nmi, on average how many csv files we need to processed ? how long it takes to process this csv files ?
- any systems is depending on the the output and    
2. Create a new class (e.g. SimpleNem12ParserImpl) that implements interface `SimpleNem12Parser`.

How you implement this class and solve this problem is entirely up to you.
You can use any external libraries deemed suitable but be judicious and where necessary, provide 
clear instructions on how best to review your work.

You cannot modify SimpleNem12.csv.  Any changes to the provided domain model are fine though they shouldn't be necessary.
